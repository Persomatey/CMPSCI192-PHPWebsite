I will continue by the instructions above and the 'Exercise' section of Chapter 1 which is also listed above. The primary reason I have for taking this class is because it is the last class that I need for my degree. Being said, PHP will help me along my journey in web development. I've heard from several developers that PHP is a 'dead language' and that most devs use javascript instead nowadays. On the other hand, my brother, who is a web developer, sometimes has to use PHP at his job, mostly in some of the older legacy systems. In such cases, I think it's important to have a strong foundation of PHP. PHP also seems like a very flexible language. A lot of the sections in this chapter mention that PHP can run on pretty much any OS with great performance which I think is a useful feature that could help me with future projects. It's no surprise that it serves as the foundation of so many legacy systems at companies. For my three projects, I'm thinking kind of small. First, I would like to make a playing card shuffling program to test the OOP functionality of the language as well as some simple randomness. Second, a simple text-based video game would be fun where a player tries to escape a dungeon by choosing left, right, center, or back with events happening in certain rooms. Lastly, a basic forum where users can go through sub-forum rooms and submit text-based threads, read other people's threads, and reply to threads.";
