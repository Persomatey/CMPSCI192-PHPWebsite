# Hunter Goodin Portfolio

This is the repository that I am using for my personal website. 

The website can be accessed at https://persomatey.github.io/HunterGoodinWebsite/ and at https://www.huntergoodin.com. 

The domain was purchased on Hover. 

The page directs the user to three different pages. One for tinkering, one for game development, and one for photography. 

The tinkering page is still a WIP. 

The game development page directs the user to https://www.huntergoodin.dev. 

The photography page is still a WIP.
