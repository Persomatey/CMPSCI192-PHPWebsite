# Hunter Goodin Website

This is the repository that I am using for my personal website. 

The website can be accessed at https://persomatey.github.io/HunterGoodinWebsite/ and at https://www.huntergoodin.com. 

The domain was purchased on Hover. Using https://dev.to/nickymarino/pointing-a-github-pages-repo-to-a-hover-domain-105e as a tutorial for this. 

The page directs the user to three different pages. One for tinkering, one for game development, and one for photography. 

The tinkering page is still a WIP. 

The game development page directs the user to a site similar to https://www.huntergoodin.dev. 

The photography page is still a WIP.
